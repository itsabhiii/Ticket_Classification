# Ticket_Classification
This model can be really helful for the Organization here I am trying to classify the daily alerts by customer to segmented into the different Teams who works on the problem based on the given description.
I have also used the concept of Pipeline to make the model more efficient to go and will able to classify correctly.

Model can be really affective and saved the ticket distribution time internally between the teams and helps the client to get the resolution in more faster way!
